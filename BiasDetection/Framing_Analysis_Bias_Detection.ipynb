Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta all revealed massive increases in spending in the first six months of 2024 \\u2014 totalling $106bn \\u2014 in their latest quarterly earnings reports, as their leaders brushed off stock market jitters to pledge further investment hikes over the next 18 months. \\u201cAt this point, I\\u2019d rather risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late,\\u201d Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg said this week, as he predicted the Facebook parent\\u2019s capital spending could hit $40bn this year. Their collective forecasts mean Big Tech\\u2019s AI-related investment could more than double by year-end. Analysts at Dell\\u2019Oro Group now expect as much as $1tn could be channelled into infrastructure such as data centres within five years, even though the companies have so far failed to convince investors that their customers are prepared to spend big on AI products and services. \\u201cTech management teams are pressing their bets on spending,\\u201d said Jim Tierney, head of US growth at AllianceBernstein. \\u201cInvestors are still unclear what all the business models and pay-offs are. This is creating a \\u2018trust us\\u2019 environment which is not overly comforting given the aggregate spending.\\u201d Big Tech\\u2019s latest round of earnings reports collided with a broader dive in Wall Street sentiment, as the Nasdaq fell into a correction on Friday on weaker US jobs numbers. Shares in semiconductor companies, including the leading AI chipmaker Nvidia, have been particularly volatile this week as investors grew more sensitive to Big Tech\\u2019s comments on spending plans. Nvidia gained or lost about $200bn in each of three successive trading sessions, while Intel, which is yet to capture much of the spending on AI infrastructure owing to its lack of competitive products, lost more than a quarter of its value on Friday after announcing massive job cuts. Yet even as the stocks of Google, Microsoft and Amazon sold off in the immediate wake of their earnings reports, Big Tech executives made no apologies for their spending spree. Zuckerberg estimated the amount of computing power required to train its next large language model would be \\u201calmost 10 times more\\u201d than the previous version, even while conceding that it would be \\u201cyears\\u201d before some of its AI features, such as its Meta AI chatbot, made any money \\u201cby themselves\\u201d. \\u201cIn tech when you are going through transitions like this . . . the risk of underinvesting [in AI] is dramatically higher than overinvesting,\\u201d said Google chief executive Sundar Pichai. After Google\\u2019s parent Alphabet last week reported a 90 per cent surge in capital spending in the first two quarters of 2024 to $25bn, Microsoft on Tuesday responded with a 78 per cent increase to $33bn.

It makes me feel more connected to this community.\\\" MacLeod is a proud advocate of Sandwich's live music scene \\u2014 a vibrant and active community he says is hidden in plain sight. For MacLeod, the comradery within the small community binds them closer together. \\\"Small and tight is community, and it works for us, not against us.\\\" MacLeod said. MacLeod, who is a high school English teacher, has been performing original and cover rock songs in Sandwich for over 20 years. He hosts a monthly songwriter series at Dominion House Tavern called \\\"Strumming Through The Smog.\\\" MacLeod credits bars such as Dominion House and MD's Sports Bar and Smokehouse for hosting and supporting musicians that perform in Sandwich, but said that the setting can be uncomfortable to some. \\\"Some people just don't like going to bars, and I get it, and I don't think the only place people should experience music is in a bar,\\\" MacLeod said. \\\"So, I think the important thing is to make use of spaces like this (the John Muir Library) and Mackenzie Hall more often if we really want to develop the music culture in Sandwich.\\\" Hugh Leal has over 40 years of experience working as a concert promoter, record label executive and musician. He currently is the producer of the Windsor Jazz Concert Series. Leal says that part of the difficulty with local live music planning is the ease of accessibility to mainstream music through streaming platforms like Spotify, and how it deters audiences from seeing performances live. \\\"I think the technology surrounding digital sharing has really clobbered music,\\\" Leal said. \\\"It turns out that music is a real basic human expression with a lot of positive things, but it's fragile and it's been damaged in my opinion because of people's devaluing of it.\\\" The Windsor Jazz Concert Series recently hosted the Old Town's Jazz Day in Sandwich, a music festival that highlighted local jazz talent from Windsor and Detroit. Leal is optimistic that festivals like these in Sandwich will continue due to the benefits that live music brings to communities. \\\"I think anything that brings the community together, to get them out of their houses and to get them away from their iPhones, I think [live music] is good for the community,\\\" Leal said. For the live music venues in Sandwich like Dominion House Tavern, community means everything. Jordan \\\"Jordo\\\" Tough is the owner and manager of \\\"the DH.\\\" He is also in charge of concert bookings there, which take place five to seven nights a week. Tough expressed his deep appreciation for Windsor's music community and how the music creates a sense of\",\n          \"Indika cuts an unlikely figure as a gaming heroine. Though handy with a wrench, she\\u2019s less concerned with saving the world and more with saving her soul. In place of a utility belt or gun holster, she wears a flowing robe and wimple. As a nun in a 19th-century Russian monastery, the clothes are an essential part of the job. This ultra-stylish game from Russian studio Odd Meter tells the story of one nun\\u2019s dramatic struggle with her faith. The development team are originally from Moscow and they felt uneasy about how their game\\u2019s critique of the Russian Orthodox church would be viewed by Putin\\u2019s government. Shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, most of the developers decided to move to Kazakhstan for their own safety. In the run-up to the game\\u2019s release, they went public with their strong anti-war stance. \\u201cIn Russia the government always reminds you: \\u2018If you say something wrong, we\\u2019ll put you in jail\\u2019,\\u201d says the game\\u2019s writer and director, Dmitry Svetlow. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t feel comfortable living in a place where I was threatened like that.\\u201d Players begin the game trudging through the snow, performing mundane tasks for the mother superior of an austere nunnery. Before long a diabolical narrator begins questioning the value of Indika\\u2019s actions and, by extension, her entire religion. You soon realise this narrator is not just speaking to the player \\u2014 Indika can hear the devil whispering in her ear. Shunned by the other nuns, she\\u2019s relieved to be given a letter to deliver to a neighbouring monastery. As Indika journeys across the bleak wintry landscape, her internal conflict is projected psychedelically on to the world around her. She joins up with escaped convict Ilya, who becomes her foil \\u2014 where she hears the devil, he receives messages from God. The pair embark on a quest to find a religious artefact with healing properties. She seeks to redeem her soul, he to heal his gravely wounded arm. The gameplay is rather simple. You are mainly walking around or engaging in light platforming and environmental puzzles. These serve as the backdrop to the real action: the metaphysical war playing out in Indika\\u2019s mind. She debates topics such as sin and the nature of the soul with Ilya and the devilish voice in her head. While games often explore ideas of morality and faith, rarely are these subjects so explicitly grounded in real-world religions. \\u201cGames are grown-up entertainment now,\\u201d says Svetlow, \\u201cthe industry is starting to create more serious, sophisticated stories.\\u201d Other games that have tackled questions of religion include the thoughtful exploration of fictional faiths in the Fallout and Baldur\\u2019s Gate series, or the more artistic approach to metaphysical topics in indie games Journey and That Dragon, Cancer. Indika\\u2019s harshly critical view of the Russian church was inspired by Svetlow\\u2019s own atheist awakening. After a childhood of church services and pilgrimages, he renounced his faith when he was 15. \\u201cThe main idea I took away from the Russian Orthodox religion is that you\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"image\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 40945,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"images/6e4917b472.jpg\",\n          \"images/519b92ea1b.jpg\",\n          \"images/87fc0faebc.jpg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"nlp_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Likely to be Unbiased\",\n          \"Likely to be Bias\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"nlp-image_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Likely to be Bias\",\n          \"Likely to be Unbiased\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"dominant_topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 7,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 59,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 56,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.07727516861576841,\n        \"min\": -0.2950034872534873,\n        \"max\": 0.5610185185185185,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 36895,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0582590612002376,\n          -0.0783808048012593\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"frames\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[]\",\n          \"['security', 'political']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"entities\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 38943,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['WASHINGTON', 'Joe Biden', 'Tuesday', '$127 million', 'June', '$38 million', 'the last four days of the month', 'Biden', 'last week', 'June', 'monthly', '2024', 'Hollywood', 'Barack Obama', '$30 million', 'Biden', 'June', '$112 million', 'Donald Trump', 'June', 'the first month', 'Biden', 'Trump', 'March', 'the previous two months', 'Biden', '$264 million', 'the second quarter and now', '$240 million', '$212 million', 'the end of May', 'Trump', '$331 million', 'the second quarter', '$285 million', '$45 million', 'Biden', 'Biden', 'last Thursday', 'the day', 'Biden', 'Donald Trump', 'Friday', 'second', 'Biden', 'Democrats', 'Biden', 'Julie Chavez Rodriguez', 'Biden', 'Kamala Harris', 'Trump', 'Chris LaCivita', 'Susie Wiles', 'Trump', 'Biden', 'nearly $120 million', 'Democrats', 'Biden', 'New York', 'Trump', 'Biden', 'May', 'April', 'Biden', 'Trump', '$76 million', 'April', '$51 million', 'Biden', 'that month']\",\n          \"['40-year-old', 'Lower Manhattan', 'First', '20 minutes', 'a few minutes', 'half', 'one', 'two', 'her best day', 'Mary Lynn Chu', 'Chu', 'Muscular Dystrophy Association', 'N.Y.U.

It\\u2019s not: There are two still sweet utility deals on the board, offering both high dividends (up to 7%) and steadily growing payouts. Why are these bargains still available? We\\u2019ll get to that shortly. First, let\\u2019s talk about why utilities have been at the top of our buy list this year: When interest rates fall, \\u201cutes\\u201d fly. Most people see utilities as bond proxies, which is why they got crushed when rates spiked in \\u201922. Why bother with even low-volatility utilities when you can get a guaranteed near-5% payout from a 2-Year Treasury? But when rates fall, and that sweet Treasury income is off the table, people come running back to utilities. The result can be some shockingly big moves for a normally mellow sector. Consider American Electric Power (AEP), which we bought in the February issue of my Hidden Yields service. Man, a lot has changed since then. Back in late February, we\\u2019d just gotten a hotter-than-expected CPI report, and the inflation boogeyman returned. The media fretted that, after all those rate hikes, the Fed would fail to \\u201cstick the landing,\\u201d as Bloomberg cleverly stated: We didn\\u2019t buy it. The Fed clearly had rates in restrictive territory, so it was a question of when, not if, inflation would drop. Six months on, inflation is at 2.9%, the high end of the Fed\\u2019s target range. And Jay Powell flat-out told us rate cuts are now ahead from the Fed\\u2019s Jackson Hole confab on Friday. And the so-called \\u201clong rate\\u201d\\u2014the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, has dropped from 4.3% to around 3.8% as of this writing. American Electric? It\\u2019s up a tidy 22.7%\\u2014a titanic move for a utility. Plenty of utilities have done the same, and to be honest, we see most as holds now (including AEP). But as I said, there are still a couple that have been overlooked. The first one is a US firm with considerable operations beyond America\\u2019s borders. The other is a telecom stock based in Canada\\u2014a country where just three companies rule the wireless roost. And Canadians, like Americans, are not going to cut their cell phone use, recession or no. Utility Bargain No. 1: AES Corp. (AES) AES Corp. yields 3.9% as I write this, and its dividend does what you\\u2019d expect from a steady-as-she goes business like this: It steadily grinds higher. Check out the slow \\u2019n\\u2019 steady staircase of payout hikes over the last nine years (through rising rates, falling rates and the pandemic), as well as the effect that payout growth has had on the share price. Just like a poorly behaved dog on a leash, the stock price (in orange) sometimes jumps ahead of the payout and sometimes falls behind. But ultimately it comes right back to the purple line. Right now it\\u2019s behind\\u2014a sign that AES is undervalued. You can also see in the chart\",\n          \"Between the European parliament elections on June 9 and the forthcoming French parliamentary elections on June 30 and July 7, France seems to have returned to a traditional pattern: left against right or, more precisely, \\u201cprogressives\\u201d against \\u201cfascists\\u201d. The liberal centre, President Emmanuel Macron\\u2019s electoral base, has apparently collapsed, as has the former Gaullist party Les R\\u00e9publicains. On the left, although the moderate Parti Socialiste recovered some ground on June 9, the political scene is dominated by the radical and very vocal La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), headed by Jean-Luc M\\u00e9lenchon, which just trailed them. The Greens, meanwhile, can provide no more than a marginal boost for the left. The earthquake is the advance of the far right. The Rassemblement National (RN) of Marine Le Pen \\u2014 formerly the Front National \\u2014 won 31.5 per cent of the French votes for the European parliament, to which one should add the more radical Reconqu\\u00eate headed by \\u00c9ric Zemmour, at 5.5 per cent. What happened? Macron won the presidency in 2017 by uniting the centre-right and centre-left under his new party, En Marche (now called Renaissance), splitting the Socialists and Les R\\u00e9publicains. These two parties never really recovered from the hijacking of their moderate wings. The rise of Le Pen\\u2019s RN in polls and elections gave the impression that French society was drifting to the right, a pattern shared by many European countries. Consequently, instead of remaining firm at the centre, Macron turned to a more rightist policy on social benefits, immigration, Islam and public order; he also extolled patriotism and pledged to fight \\u201cwokism\\u201d in academia. He remained liberal only on feminist and gender issues, with the right to abortion added to the constitution. This shift squeezed Les R\\u00e9publicains between the RN and Macron\\u2019s party, without bringing new votes from the right for Macron. On paper there is still a centrist electorate, if we add the Parti Socialiste score to that of Renaissance and half of Les R\\u00e9publicains, roughly speaking the pro-European voters: together they made up more than 30 per cent at the European elections. But Macron\\u2019s personal and narcissistic management makes it quite impossible to revive such a coalition and his party is now crumbling. We are heading towards a \\u201ccohabitation\\u201d between the president and a hostile majority. The only question is whether Le Pen\\u2019s RN will have sufficient numbers to impose its candidate as prime minister, or whether chaos will prevail in France\\u2019s Assembl\\u00e9e Nationale. Meanwhile, the left is sounding the bugle against fascism. It replays the 1930s by setting against the extreme right a \\u201cPopular Front\\u201d that unites the Parti Socialiste, La France Insoumise, the French Communist party and the Greens. This coalition has nevertheless antagonised many centrists who hate M\\u00e9lenchon because of his support for Palestinians and multiculturalism, and who would have preferred a call for a \\u201cRepublican Front\\u201d that could exclude extremists from both right and left. But in any case, this paradigm simply does not work any more. Society has changed. The young do\",\n          \"MILWAUKEE, July 15 (Reuters) - Eight years ago, in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, J.D. Vance was a bitter critic of Donald Trump. Publicly, he called the Republican presidential candidate an \\\"idiot\\\" and said he was \\\"reprehensible.\\\" Privately, he compared him to Adolf Hitler. But by the time the former president tapped Vance to be his running mate on Monday, the Ohio native had become one of Trump's most ardent defenders, standing by his side even when other high-profile Republicans declined to do so. James David Vance's transformation - from self-described \\\"never Trumper\\\" to stalwart loyalist - makes him a relatively unusual figure in Trump's inner circle. Democrats and even some Republicans have questioned whether Vance, who wrote a bestselling memoir \\\"Hillbilly Elegy\\\" and is now a U.S. senator from Ohio, is driven more by opportunism than ideology. But Trump, who survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania campaign rally on Saturday, and many of his advisers see his transformation as genuine. They point out that Vance's political beliefs - which mix isolationism with economic populism - dovetail with those of Trump, and put both men at odds with the old guard of the Republican Party, where foreign policy hawks and free market evangelists still hold sway. Republican Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, whom Vance has described as a mentor, told Reuters that Vance shifted his views on Trump because \\u201che saw the successes that President Trump as president brought to the country.\\u201d In particular, Vance's vocal opposition to U.S. aid for Ukraine in its war with Russia has delighted Trump's most conservative allies, even as it has upset some Senate colleagues. \\\"He understands what Trump is running on and, unlike the rest of the Republican Party in Washington, agrees with it,\\\" conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, a vocal Vance supporter, told Reuters. Vance, 39, was born into an impoverished home in southern Ohio. His pick may help boost the Trump campaign's Rust Belt bona fides in a race that will be determined by voters in a handful of battleground states, including nearby Pennsylvania and Michigan, though his conservative views may be a turn-off for moderate voters. \\\"To the extent that he can do anything for the ticket, it would be to recapture being the voice of the American dream,\\\" said David Niven, an associate professor of politics at the University of Cincinnati who has worked as a speechwriter for two Democratic governors, referring to Vance's rise from poverty to U.S senator and vice presidential candidate. After serving in the Marine Corps, attending Yale Law School and working as a venture capitalist in San Francisco, Vance rose to national prominence thanks to his 2016 book \\\"Hillbilly Elegy.\\\" In that memoir, he explored the socioeconomic problems confronting his hometown and attempted to explain Trump's popularity among impoverished white Americans to readers. He was harshly critical of Trump, both publicly and privately, in 2016 and during the opening stages of his 2017-2021 term. \\\"I go back and forth between thinking Trump\"\n        ],\n

It\\u2019s not: There are two still sweet utility deals on the board, offering both high dividends (up to 7%) and steadily growing payouts. Why are these bargains still available? We\\u2019ll get to that shortly. First, let\\u2019s talk about why utilities have been at the top of our buy list this year: When interest rates fall, \\u201cutes\\u201d fly. Most people see utilities as bond proxies, which is why they got crushed when rates spiked in \\u201922. Why bother with even low-volatility utilities when you can get a guaranteed near-5% payout from a 2-Year Treasury? But when rates fall, and that sweet Treasury income is off the table, people come running back to utilities. The result can be some shockingly big moves for a normally mellow sector. Consider American Electric Power (AEP), which we bought in the February issue of my Hidden Yields service. Man, a lot has changed since then. Back in late February, we\\u2019d just gotten a hotter-than-expected CPI report, and the inflation boogeyman returned. The media fretted that, after all those rate hikes, the Fed would fail to \\u201cstick the landing,\\u201d as Bloomberg cleverly stated: We didn\\u2019t buy it. The Fed clearly had rates in restrictive territory, so it was a question of when, not if, inflation would drop. Six months on, inflation is at 2.9%, the high end of the Fed\\u2019s target range. And Jay Powell flat-out told us rate cuts are now ahead from the Fed\\u2019s Jackson Hole confab on Friday. And the so-called \\u201clong rate\\u201d\\u2014the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, has dropped from 4.3% to around 3.8% as of this writing. American Electric? It\\u2019s up a tidy 22.7%\\u2014a titanic move for a utility. Plenty of utilities have done the same, and to be honest, we see most as holds now (including AEP). But as I said, there are still a couple that have been overlooked. The first one is a US firm with considerable operations beyond America\\u2019s borders. The other is a telecom stock based in Canada\\u2014a country where just three companies rule the wireless roost. And Canadians, like Americans, are not going to cut their cell phone use, recession or no. Utility Bargain No. 1: AES Corp. (AES) AES Corp. yields 3.9% as I write this, and its dividend does what you\\u2019d expect from a steady-as-she goes business like this: It steadily grinds higher. Check out the slow \\u2019n\\u2019 steady staircase of payout hikes over the last nine years (through rising rates, falling rates and the pandemic), as well as the effect that payout growth has had on the share price. Just like a poorly behaved dog on a leash, the stock price (in orange) sometimes jumps ahead of the payout and sometimes falls behind. But ultimately it comes right back to the purple line. Right now it\\u2019s behind\\u2014a sign that AES is undervalued. You can also see in the chart\",\n          \"Between the European parliament elections on June 9 and the forthcoming French parliamentary elections on June 30 and July 7, France seems to have returned to a traditional pattern: left against right or, more precisely, \\u201cprogressives\\u201d against \\u201cfascists\\u201d. The liberal centre, President Emmanuel Macron\\u2019s electoral base, has apparently collapsed, as has the former Gaullist party Les R\\u00e9publicains. On the left, although the moderate Parti Socialiste recovered some ground on June 9, the political scene is dominated by the radical and very vocal La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), headed by Jean-Luc M\\u00e9lenchon, which just trailed them. The Greens, meanwhile, can provide no more than a marginal boost for the left. The earthquake is the advance of the far right. The Rassemblement National (RN) of Marine Le Pen \\u2014 formerly the Front National \\u2014 won 31.5 per cent of the French votes for the European parliament, to which one should add the more radical Reconqu\\u00eate headed by \\u00c9ric Zemmour, at 5.5 per cent. What happened? Macron won the presidency in 2017 by uniting the centre-right and centre-left under his new party, En Marche (now called Renaissance), splitting the Socialists and Les R\\u00e9publicains. These two parties never really recovered from the hijacking of their moderate wings. The rise of Le Pen\\u2019s RN in polls and elections gave the impression that French society was drifting to the right, a pattern shared by many European countries. Consequently, instead of remaining firm at the centre, Macron turned to a more rightist policy on social benefits, immigration, Islam and public order; he also extolled patriotism and pledged to fight \\u201cwokism\\u201d in academia. He remained liberal only on feminist and gender issues, with the right to abortion added to the constitution. This shift squeezed Les R\\u00e9publicains between the RN and Macron\\u2019s party, without bringing new votes from the right for Macron. On paper there is still a centrist electorate, if we add the Parti Socialiste score to that of Renaissance and half of Les R\\u00e9publicains, roughly speaking the pro-European voters: together they made up more than 30 per cent at the European elections. But Macron\\u2019s personal and narcissistic management makes it quite impossible to revive such a coalition and his party is now crumbling. We are heading towards a \\u201ccohabitation\\u201d between the president and a hostile majority. The only question is whether Le Pen\\u2019s RN will have sufficient numbers to impose its candidate as prime minister, or whether chaos will prevail in France\\u2019s Assembl\\u00e9e Nationale. Meanwhile, the left is sounding the bugle against fascism. It replays the 1930s by setting against the extreme right a \\u201cPopular Front\\u201d that unites the Parti Socialiste, La France Insoumise, the French Communist party and the Greens. This coalition has nevertheless antagonised many centrists who hate M\\u00e9lenchon because of his support for Palestinians and multiculturalism, and who would have preferred a call for a \\u201cRepublican Front\\u201d that could exclude extremists from both right and left. But in any case, this paradigm simply does not work any more. Society has changed. The young do\",\n          \"MILWAUKEE, July 15 (Reuters) - Eight years ago, in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, J.D. Vance was a bitter critic of Donald Trump. Publicly, he called the Republican presidential candidate an \\\"idiot\\\" and said he was \\\"reprehensible.\\\" Privately, he compared him to Adolf Hitler. But by the time the former president tapped Vance to be his running mate on Monday, the Ohio native had become one of Trump's most ardent defenders, standing by his side even when other high-profile Republicans declined to do so. James David Vance's transformation - from self-described \\\"never Trumper\\\" to stalwart loyalist - makes him a relatively unusual figure in Trump's inner circle. Democrats and even some Republicans have questioned whether Vance, who wrote a bestselling memoir \\\"Hillbilly Elegy\\\" and is now a U.S. senator from Ohio, is driven more by opportunism than ideology. But Trump, who survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania campaign rally on Saturday, and many of his advisers see his transformation as genuine. They point out that Vance's political beliefs - which mix isolationism with economic populism - dovetail with those of Trump, and put both men at odds with the old guard of the Republican Party, where foreign policy hawks and free market evangelists still hold sway. Republican Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, whom Vance has described as a mentor, told Reuters that Vance shifted his views on Trump because \\u201che saw the successes that President Trump as president brought to the country.\\u201d In particular, Vance's vocal opposition to U.S. aid for Ukraine in its war with Russia has delighted Trump's most conservative allies, even as it has upset some Senate colleagues. \\\"He understands what Trump is running on and, unlike the rest of the Republican Party in Washington, agrees with it,\\\" conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, a vocal Vance supporter, told Reuters. Vance, 39, was born into an impoverished home in southern Ohio. His pick may help boost the Trump campaign's Rust Belt bona fides in a race that will be determined by voters in a handful of battleground states, including nearby Pennsylvania and Michigan, though his conservative views may be a turn-off for moderate voters. \\\"To the extent that he can do anything for the ticket, it would be to recapture being the voice of the American dream,\\\" said David Niven, an associate professor of politics at the University of Cincinnati who has worked as a speechwriter for two Democratic governors, referring to Vance's rise from poverty to U.S senator and vice presidential candidate. After serving in the Marine Corps, attending Yale Law School and working as a venture capitalist in San Francisco, Vance rose to national prominence thanks to his 2016 book \\\"Hillbilly Elegy.\\\" In that memoir, he explored the socioeconomic problems confronting his hometown and attempted to explain Trump's popularity among impoverished white Americans to readers. He was harshly critical of Trump, both publicly and privately, in 2016 and during the opening stages of his 2017-2021 term. \\\"I go back and forth between thinking Trump\"\n        ],\n
